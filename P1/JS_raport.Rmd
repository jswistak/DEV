## Data visualization recap - Vinho Verde

I have created several graphs to visualize the data.


### Investigating the distribution of alcohol variable
```{r echo=FALSE}
a()

```


### Comparing the distribution of alcohol variable between two types of wine i.e. red and white
```{r echo=FALSE}
b()

```



### Comparing the distribution of alcohol variable in each of possible quality group defined by response variable
```{r echo=FALSE}
c_func()

```

### Percentage of red and white wines within each quality group
```{r echo=FALSE}
d()

```


### Investigating the relationship between variables describing acidity of the wines

```{r echo=FALSE}
e()

```
